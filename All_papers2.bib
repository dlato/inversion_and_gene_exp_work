@article{Roch:02,
abstract = {Replication generates bacterial chromosomes with strands that differ in the number of genes and base composition. It has been suggested that in bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, PolC is responsible for the synthesis of the leading strand and DnaE for the lagging strand, whereas in many other bacteria DnaE is responsible for the synthesis of both strands. Here, I show that the possession of PolC correlates with leading strands that contain an average of 78{\%} of genes compared with 58{\%} for genomes that do not contain PolC. This suggests that asymmetrical replication forks could have a major role in defining and constraining the structure of the bacterial chromosome. The presence of PolC is not correlated with compositional strand bias, suggesting that the two biases result from different types of structural asymmetry.},

abstract = {We created a visualization tool, called Circos, to facilitate the identification and analysis of similarities and differences arising from comparisons of genomes. Our tool is effective in displaying variation in genome structure and, generally, any other kind of positional relationships between genomic intervals. Such data are routinely produced by sequence alignments, hybridization arrays, genome mapping, and genotyping studies. Circos uses a circular ideogram layout to facilitate the display of relationships between pairs of positions by the use of ribbons, which encode the position, size, and orientation of related genomic elements. Circos is capable of displaying data as scatter, line and histogram plots, heat maps, tiles, connectors and text. Bitmap or vector images can be created from GFF-style data inputs and hierarchical configuration files, which can be easily generated by automated tools, making Circos suitable for rapid deployment in data analysis and reporting pipelines.},

live-cell imaging, and computational modeling. Using chromosome conformation
capture carbon copy (5C), we derive {\~{}}13 kb resolution 3D models of the
Caulobacter genome. The resulting models illustrate that the genome is
ellipsoidal with periodically arranged arms. The parS sites, a pair of short
contiguous sequence elements known to be involved in chromosome segregation, are
positioned at one pole, where they anchor the chromosome to the cell and
contribute to the formation of a compact chromatin conformation. Repositioning
these elements resulted in rotations of the chromosome that changed the
subcellular positions of most genes. Such rotations did not lead to large-scale
changes in gene expression, indicating that genome folding does not strongly
affect gene regulation. Collectively, our data suggest that genome folding is
globally dictated by the parS sites and chromosome segregation.},

abstract = {DNA (class 2) transposons are mobile genetic elements which move within their ‘host' genome through excising and re-inserting elsewhere. Although the rice genome contains tens of thousands of such elements, their actual role in evolution is still unclear. Analysing over 650 transposon polymorphisms in the rice species Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima, we find that DNA repair following transposon excisions is associated with an increased number of mutations in the sequences neighbouring the transposon. Indeed, the 3,000 bp flanking the excised transposons can contain over 10 times more mutations than the genome-wide average. Since DNA transposons preferably insert near genes, this is correlated with increases in mutation rates in coding sequences and regulatory regions. Most importantly, we find this phenomenon also in maize, wheat and barley. Thus, these findings suggest that DNA transposon activity is a major evolutionary force in grasses which provide the basis of most food consumed by humankind.},

abstract = {Identification of the consensus sequence for termination of replication (ter) in Escherichia coli and the isolation of the ter-binding protein (TBP) allowed us to test their effects on replication forks initiated at the unique origin of the E. coli chromosome (oriC) in a purified enzyme system. Replication was severely impeded by ter in a unique orientation when purified TBP was supplied to bind it. The target for blockage within the replication complex can now be ascribed to the inability of dnaB helicase to separate the duplex strands when it encounters ter bound by TBP. Other helicases, such as rep and uvrD proteins, that translocate on DNA and displace strands in the direction opposite to that of dnaB protein are also blocked, but only when the TBP-bound ter is oriented in the other direction. From these results, we infer that the orientation of ter confers a particular polarity on the TBP seated on it, such that a helicase is blocked when it confronts TBP from one side, but can act, presumably by displacing TBP, when facing its other side. Thus, the intrinsic nature of the oriented TBP-ter complex is responsible for impeding the helicases, rather than any protein-protein interactions.},

In order to probe the molecular mechanism of this inhibition, we have used a strand displacement assay to investigate the effect of Tus on the DNA helicase activities of DnaB, PriA, UvrD (helicase II), and the phi X-type primosome. When the substrate was a short oligomer hybridized to a circular single-stranded DNA, strand displacement by DnaB, PriA, and the primosome (in both directions), but not UvrD, was blocked by Tus in a polar fashion. However, no inhibition of either DnaB or UvrD was observed when the substrate carried an elongated duplex region. With this elongated substrate, PriA helicase activity was only inhibited partially (by 50{\%}). On the other hand, both the 5'----3' and 3'----5' helicase activities of the primosome were inhibited almost completely by Tus with the elongated substrate. These results suggest that while Tus can inhibit the translocation of some proteins along single-stranded DNA in a polar fashion, this generalized effect is insufficient for the inhibition of bona fide DNA helicase activity.},

Thus, the genetic repertoire of a given species (its "pan-genome") is much larger than the gene content of individual strains. These variations in DNA material, together with differences in genomic structure and nucleotide polymorphisms among strains, confer upon prokaryotic species a phenomenal adaptability. Although the approach of sequencing multiple strains from a single species remains the main and often easiest way to study the pan-genome, feasible alternatives include those related to DNA hybridization. In other cases, the use of metagenomic sequences is already applicable by data mining from the growing metagenomic databases. Eventually, the single-cell genome approach might be the ideal solution. The pan-genome concept has important consequences for the way we understand bacterial evolution, adaptation, and population structure, as well as for more applied issues such as vaccine design or the identification of virulence genes.},

The complete sequences of the more closely related bacterial genomes, such as pairs of Chlamydia, H. pylori and Mycobacterium species, now allow identification of the processes and mechanisms involved in genome evolution.

Native Taq polymerases had similar extension rates of 10-45 nt/s. Three alternative polymerases showed faster speeds, including KOD (76 nt/s), Klentaq I (101 nt/s), and KAPA2G (155 nt/s). Fusion polymerases including Herculase II and Phusion were relatively slow (3-13 nt/s). The pH optimum for Klentaq extension was between 8.5 and 8.7 with no effect of Tris concentration. Activity was directly correlated to the MgCl2 concentration and inversely correlated to the KCl concentration. This continuous assay is relevant to PCR and provides accurate measurement of polymerase activity using a defined template without the need of radiolabeled substrates. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Streptomyces coelicolor is a representative of the group of soil-dwelling, filamentous bacteria responsible for producing most natural antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine. Here we report the 8,667,507 base pair linear chromosome of this organism, containing the largest number of genes so far discovered in a bacterium. The 7,825 predicted genes include more than 20 clusters coding for known or predicted secondary metabolites. The genome contains an unprecedented proportion of regulatory genes, predominantly those likely to be involved in responses to external stimuli and stresses, and many duplicated gene sets that may represent 'tissue-specific' isoforms operating in different phases of colonial development, a unique situation for a bacterium. An ancient synteny was revealed between the central 'core' of the chromosome and the whole chromosome of pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The genome sequence will greatly increase our understanding of microbial life in the soil as well as aiding the generation of new drug candidates by genetic engineering.},

abstract = {In contrast to organized hierarchical structure of eukaryotic chromosome, bacterial chromosomes are believed not to have such structures. The genomes of bacteria are condensed into a compact structure called the nucleoid. Among many architectural, histone-like proteins which associate with the chromosomal DNA is HU which is implicated in folding DNA into a compact structure by bending and wrapping DNA. Unlike the majority of other histone-like proteins, HU is highly conserved in eubacteria and unique in its ability to bind RNA. Furthermore, an HU mutation profoundly alters the cellular transcription profile and consequently has global effects on physiology and the lifestyle of E. coli. Here we provide a short overview of the mechanisms by which the nucleoid is organized into different topological domains. We propose that HU is a major player in creating domain-specific superhelicities and thus influences the transcription profile from the constituent promoters.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Replication of bacterial chromosomes increases copy numbers of genes located near origins of replication relative to genes located near termini. Such differential gene dosage depends on replication rate, doubling time and chromosome size. Although little explored, differential gene dosage may influence both gene expression and location. For vibrios, a diverse family of fast growing gammaproteobacteria, gene dosage may be particularly important as they harbor two chromosomes of different size. RESULTS: Here we examined replication dynamics and gene dosage effects for the separate chromosomes of three Vibrio species. We also investigated locations for specific gene types within the genome. The results showed consistently larger gene dosage differences for the large chromosome which also initiated replication long before the small. Accordingly, large chromosome gene expression levels were generally higher and showed an influence from gene dosage. This was reflected by a higher abundance of growth essential and growth contributing genes of which many locate near the origin of replication. In contrast, small chromosome gene expression levels were low and appeared independent of gene dosage. Also, species specific genes are highly abundant and an over-representation of genes involved in transcription could explain its gene dosage independent expression. CONCLUSION: Here we establish a link between replication dynamics and differential gene dosage on one hand and gene expression levels and the location of specific gene types on the other. For vibrios, this relationship appears connected to a polarisation of genetic content between its chromosomes, which may both contribute to and be enhanced by an improved adaptive capacity.},

@article{tophat,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: A new protocol for sequencing the messenger RNA in a cell, known as RNA-Seq, generates millions of short sequence fragments in a single run. These fragments, or 'reads', can be used to measure levels of gene expression and to identify novel splice variants of genes. However, current software for aligning RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on known splice junctions and cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to a reference genome without relying on known splice sites. RESULTS: We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from a recent mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than 72{\%} of the splice junctions reported by the annotation-based software from that study, along with nearly 20,000 previously unreported junctions. The TopHat pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping nearly 2.2 million reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process an entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop computer. We describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice site discovery from RNA-Seq reads that will require further algorithm development. AVAILABILITY: TopHat is free, open-source software available from http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

We asked whether the same genes that evolve rapidly in the long-term evolution experiment with Escherichia coli (LTEE) have also diversified extensively in nature. To make this comparison, we identified approximately 2000 core genes shared among 60 E. coli strains. During the LTEE, core genes accumulated significantly more nonsynonymous mutations than flexible (i.e., noncore) genes. Furthermore, core genes under positive selection in the LTEE are more conserved in nature than the average core gene. In some cases, adaptive mutations appear to modify protein functions, rather than merely knocking them out. The LTEE conditions are novel for E. coli, at least in relation to its evolutionary history in nature. The constancy and simplicity of the environment likely favor the complete loss of some unused functions and the fine-tuning of others. Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution.},

There exists a strong positive correlation between codon usage and tRNA content in both organisms, and the extent of this correlation relates to the protein production levels of individual genes. Codon-choice patterns are believed to have been well conserved during the course of evolution. Examination of silent substitutions and tRNA populations in Enterobacteriaceae revealed that the evolutionary constraint imposed by tRNA content on codon usage decelerated rather than accelerated the silent-substitution rate, at least insofar as pairs of taxonomically related organisms were examined. Codon-choice patterns of multicellular organisms are briefly reviewed, and diversity in G+C percentage at the third position of codons in vertebrate genes--as well as a possible causative factor in the production of this diversity--is discussed.},

abstract = {The stochasticity of chromosome organization was investigated by fluorescently labeling genetic loci in live Escherichia coli cells. In spite of the common assumption that the chromosome is well modeled by an unstructured polymer, measurements of the locus distributions reveal that the E. coli chromosome is precisely organized into a nucleoid filament with a linear order. Loci in the body of the nucleoid show a precision of positioning within the cell of better than 10{\%} of the cell length. The precision of interlocus distance of genomically-proximate loci was better than 4{\%} of the cell length. The measured dependence of the precision of interlocus distance on genomic distance singles out intranucleoid interactions as the mechanism responsible for chromosome organization. From the magnitude of the variance, we infer the existence of an as-yet uncharacterized higher-order DNA organization in bacteria. We demonstrate that both the stochastic and average structure of the nucleoid is captured by a fluctuating elastic filament model.},

The 7,825 predicted genes include more than 20 clusters coding for known or predicted secondary metabolites. The genome contains an unprecedented proportion of regulatory genes, predominantly those likely to be involved in responses to external stimuli and stresses, and many duplicated gene sets that may represent 'tissue-specific' isoforms operating in different phases of colonial development, a unique situation for a bacterium. An ancient synteny was revealed between the central 'core' of the chromosome and the whole chromosome of pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The genome sequence will greatly increase our understanding of microbial life in the soil as well as aiding the generation of new drug candidates by genetic engineering.},

abstract = {Sinorhizobium meliloti is a soil bacterium that fixes atmospheric nitrogen in plant roots. The high genetic diversity of its natural populations has been the subject of extensive analysis. Recent genomic studies of several isolates revealed a high content of variable genes, suggesting a correspondingly large phenotypic differentiation among strains of S. meliloti. Here, using the Phenotype MicroArray (PM) system, hundreds of different growth conditions were tested in order to compare the metabolic capabilities of the laboratory reference strain Rm1021 with those of four natural S. meliloti isolates previously analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). The results of PM analysis showed that most phenotypic differences involved carbon source utilization and tolerance to osmolytes and pH, while fewer differences were scored for nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur source utilization. Only the variability of the tested strain in tolerance to sodium nitrite and ammonium sulfate of pH 8 was hypothesized to be associated with the genetic polymorphisms detected by CGH analysis. Colony and cell morphologies and the ability to nodulate Medicago truncatula plants were also compared, revealing further phenotypic diversity. Overall, our results suggest that the study of functional (phenotypic) variability of S. meliloti populations is an important and complementary step in the investigation of genetic polymorphism of rhizobia and may help to elucidate rhizobial evolutionary dynamics, including adaptation to diverse environments.},

Bacterial genetic information is generally carried on a circular chromosome with a single origin of replication from which two replication forks proceed bidirectionally toward the opposite terminus region. Here, we investigate the higher-order architecture of the Escherichia coli genome, showing its partition into two structurally distinct entities by a complex and intertwined network of contacts: the replication terminus (ter) region and the rest of the chromosome. Outside of ter, the condensin MukBEF and the ubiquitous nucleoid-associated protein (NAP) HU promote DNA contacts in the megabase range. Within ter, the MatP protein prevents MukBEF activity, and contacts are restricted to approximately 280 kb, creating a domain with distinct structural properties. We also show how other NAPs contribute to nucleoid organization, such as H-NS, which restricts short-range interactions. Combined, these results reveal the contributions of major evolutionarily conserved proteins in a bacterial chromosome organization.},

abstract = {A statistical method was developed for reconstructing the nucleotide or amino acid sequences of extinct ancestors, given the phylogeny and sequences of the extant species. A model of nucleotide or amino acid substitution was employed to analyze data of the present-day sequences, and maximum likelihood estimates of parameters such as branch lengths were used to compare the posterior probabilities of assignments of character states (nucleotides or amino acids) to interior nodes of the tree; the assignment having the highest probability was the best reconstruction at the site. The lysozyme c sequences of six mammals were analyzed by using the likelihood and parsimony methods. The new likelihood-based method was found to be superior to the parsimony method. The probability that the amino acids for all interior nodes at a site reconstructed by the new method are correct was calculated to be 0.91, 0.86, and 0.73 for all, variable, and parsimony-informative sites, respectively, whereas the corresponding probabilities for the parsimony method were 0.84, 0.76, and 0.51, respectively. The probability that an amino acid in an ancestral sequence is correctly reconstructed by the likelihood analysis ranged from 91.3 to 98.7{\%} for the four ancestral sequences. },

@article{Kono:11,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the replication process of bacteria with circular chromosomes, an odd number of homologous recombination events results in concatenated dimer chromosomes that cannot be partitioned into daughter cells. However, many bacteria harbor a conserved dimer resolution machinery consisting of one or two tyrosine recombinases, XerC and XerD, and their 28-bp target site, dif. RESULTS: To study the evolution of the dif/XerCD system and its relationship with replication termination, we report the comprehensive prediction of dif sequences in silico using a phylogenetic prediction approach based on iterated hidden Markov modeling. Using this method, dif sites were identified in 641 organisms among 16 phyla, with a 97.64{\%} identification rate for single-chromosome strains. The dif sequence positions were shown to be strongly correlated with the GC skew shift-point that is induced by replicational mutation/selection pressures, but the difference in the positions of the predicted dif sites and the GC skew shift-points did not correlate with the degree of replicational mutation/selection pressures. CONCLUSIONS: The sequence of dif sites is widely conserved among many bacterial phyla, and they can be computationally identified using our method. The lack of correlation between dif position and the degree of GC skew suggests that replication termination does not occur strictly at dif sites.},

abstract = {Genes encoding proteins in a common regulatory network are frequently located
close to one another on the chromosome to facilitate co-regulation or couple gene
expression to growth rate. Contrasting with these observations, here, we
demonstrate a functional role for the arrangement of Bacillus subtilis
sporulation network genes on opposite sides of the chromosome. We show that the
arrangement of two sporulation network genes, one located close to the origin and
the other close to the terminus, leads to a transient gene dosage imbalance
during chromosome replication. This imbalance is detected by the sporulation
network to produce cell-cycle coordinated pulses of the sporulation master
regulator Spo0A approximately P. This pulsed response allows cells to decide
between sporulation and continued vegetative growth during each cell cycle spent
in starvation. The simplicity of this coordination mechanism suggests that it may
be widely applicable in a variety of gene regulatory and stress-response
settings. VIDEO ABSTRACT.},

@article{Koon:09,
abstract = {Charles Darwin believed that all traits of organisms have been honed to near perfection by natural selection. The empirical basis underlying Darwin's conclusions consisted of numerous observations made by him and other naturalists on the exquisite adaptations of animals and plants to their natural habitats and on the impressive results of artificial selection. Darwin fully appreciated the importance of heredity but was unaware of the nature and, in fact, the very existence of genomes. A century and a half after the publication of the "Origin", we have the opportunity to draw conclusions from the comparisons of hundreds of genome sequences from all walks of life. These comparisons suggest that the dominant mode of genome evolution is quite different from that of the phenotypic evolution. The genomes of vertebrates, those purported paragons of biological perfection, turned out to be veritable junkyards of selfish genetic elements where only a small fraction of the genetic material is dedicated to encoding biologically relevant information. In sharp contrast, genomes of microbes and viruses are incomparably more compact, with most of the genetic material assigned to distinct biological functions. However, even in these genomes, the specific genome organization (gene order) is poorly conserved. The results of comparative genomics lead to the conclusion that the genome architecture is not a straightforward result of continuous adaptation but rather is determined by the balance between the selection pressure, that is itself dependent on the effective population size and mutation rate, the level of recombination, and the activity of selfish elements. Although genes and, in many cases, multigene regions of genomes possess elaborate architectures that ensure regulation of expression, these arrangements are evolutionarily volatile and typically change substantially even on short evolutionary scales when gene sequences diverge minimally. Thus, the observed genome architectures are, mostly, products of neutral processes or epiphenomena of more general selective processes, such as selection for genome streamlining in successful lineages with large populations. Selection for specific gene arrangements (elements of genome architecture) seems only to modulate the results of these processes.},

To identify regulators of hmgA, secondary mutagenesis of an S. meliloti strain harboring a hmgA-luxAB reporter gene fusion (N4) was carried out using transposon Tn1721. Two independent Tn1721 insertions were found to be located in a positive regulatory gene (nitR), encoding a protein sharing amino acid sequence similarity with proteins of the ArsR family of regulators. NitR was found to be a regulator of S. meliloti hmgA expression under nitrogen deprivation conditions, suggesting the presence of a ntr-independent nitrogen deprivation regulatory system. nitR insertion mutations were shown not to affect bacterial growth, nodulation of Medicago sativa (alfalfa) plants, or symbiotic nitrogen fixation under the physiological conditions examined. Further analysis of the nitR locus revealed the presence of open reading frames encoding proteins sharing amino acid sequence similarities with an ATP-binding phosphonate transport protein (PhnN), as well as transmembrane efflux proteins.},

Although some explanations have been proposed, these are at most partial explanations as they cover only small percentages of the genes and do not even consider the ones biased toward the lagging strand. We have carried out a computational study on 725 bacterial genomes, aiming to elucidate other factors that may have influenced the strand location of genes in a bacterium. Our analyses suggest that (i) genes of some functional categories such as ribosome have higher preferences to be on the leading strands; (ii) genes of some functional categories such as transcription factor have higher preferences on the lagging strands; (iii) there is a balancing force that tends to keep genes from all moving to the leading and more efficient strand and (iv) the percentage of leading-strand genes in an bacterium can be accurately explained based on the numbers of genes in the functional categories outlined in (i) and (ii), genome size and gene density, indicating that these numbers implicitly contain the information about the percentage of genes on the leading versus lagging strand in a genome.},

abstract = {We have cloned the tus gene that encodes the replication terminator protein of Escherichia coli and have efficiently expressed its gene product. The overproducer strain has been used to purify the terminator (ter) protein in high yield to near homogeneity. The protein is a single 36 kd polypeptide. Using the ter protein and highly purified dnaB helicase, we show that the terminator protein is a DNA sequence-specific contra-helicase, i.e., the protein when bound to its recognition sequence (tau) strongly impedes the ATP-dependent unwinding of double-stranded DNA. This contra-helicase activity is polar, i.e., the impedance to unwinding takes place in only one orientation of the tau sequence. The results illuminate the mechanism of replication termination specifically at tau.},

abstract = {We examined codon usage in Bacillus subtilis genes by multivariate analysis, quantified its cellular levels of individual tRNAs, and found a clear constraint of tRNA contents on synonymous codon choice. Individual tRNA levels were proportional to the copy number of the respective tRNA genes. This indicates that the tRNA gene copy number is an important factor to determine in cellular tRNA levels, which is common with Escherichia coli and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Codon usage in 18 unicellular organisms whose genomes have been sequenced completely was analyzed and compared with the composition of tRNA genes. The 18 organisms are as follows: yeast S. cerevisiae, Aquifex aeolicus, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, B. subtilis, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacterpylori, Methanococcusjannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Pyrococcus horikoshii, Rickettsia prowazekii, Synechocystis sp., and Treponema pallidum. Codons preferred in highly expressed genes were related to the codons optimal for the translation process, which were predicted by the composition of isoaccepting tRNA genes. Genes with specific codon usage are discussed in connection with their evolutionary origins and functions. The origin and terminus of replication could be predicted on the basis of codon usage when the usage was analyzed relative to the transcription direction of individual genes.},

abstract = {In $\alpha$-proteobacteria, strict regulation of cell cycle progression is necessary for the specific cellular differentiation required for adaptation to diverse environmental niches. The symbiotic lifestyle of Sinorhizobium meliloti requires a drastic cellular differentiation that includes genome amplification. To achieve polyploidy, the S. meliloti cell cycle program must be altered to uncouple DNA replication from cell division. In the $\alpha$-proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus, cell cycle-regulated transcription plays an important role in the control of cell cycle progression but this has not been demonstrated in other $\alpha$-proteobacteria. Here we describe a robust method for synchronizing cell growth that enabled global analysis of S. meliloti cell cycle-regulated gene expression. This analysis identified 462 genes with cell cycle-regulated transcripts, including several key cell cycle regulators, and genes involved in motility, attachment, and cell division. Only 28{\%} of the 462 S. meliloti cell cycle-regulated genes were also transcriptionally cell cycle-regulated in C. crescentus. Furthermore, CtrA- and DnaA-binding motif analysis revealed little overlap between the cell cycle-dependent regulons of CtrA and DnaA in S. meliloti and C. crescentus. The predicted S. meliloti cell cycle regulon of CtrA, but not that of DnaA, was strongly conserved in more closely related $\alpha$-proteobacteria with similar ecological niches as S. meliloti, suggesting that the CtrA cell cycle regulatory network may control functions of central importance to the specific lifestyles of $\alpha$-proteobacteria.},

abstract = {Mothers with a CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype may expose their infants
to risk of adverse events when taking codeine while breastfeeding, by producing
more of the active metabolite, morphine. Pharmacogenetic testing may be a
valuable tool to identify such mothers, but testing can be costly. The objective
of the study was to determine the incremental costs of genotyping to avert
neonatal adverse events during maternal pharmacotherapy. A cost-effectiveness
analysis, using a decision model, was performed with a hypothetical cohort of
prenatal subjects. Parameter estimates, costs and ranges for sensitivity analyses
were ascertained from the literature and expert opinion. Sensitivity analyses
were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. Probabilistic sensitivity
analysis revealed an incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) of {\$}10 433 (Canadian
dollars) for genotyping compared to no genotyping per adverse event averted.
Results were sensitive to hospital admission costs. The ICER was lower when
evaluating only subjects having caesarean deliveries or those from ethnic
populations known to have a high prevalence of ultra-rapid metabolizers. Although
genotyping to guide pharmacotherapy was not cost saving, the cost to avert an
infant adverse event may represent good value for money in specific populations.
With a growing demand for personalized medicine, these findings are relevant for
decision makers, clinicians and patients.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance

The genome is organized in a way that facilitates chromosome maintenance and processing. Despite huge efforts, until recently little has been known about how the chromosome is organized within cells, where replication takes place, and how DNA is segregated before cell division. New techniques for labeling genetic loci and molecular machines are allowing the simultaneous tracking of genetic loci and such machines in living cells over time. These studies reveal remarkable organization, yet a highly dynamic flux of genetic loci and macromolecules. It seems likely that the cellular positioning of chromosomal loci is the outcome of the formation of two chromosome arms (replichores) by replication, followed by sequential chromosome segregation, rather than from the presence of cellular positioning markers.},

Once the bacteria have been endocytosed within a host-membrane-bound compartment by root cells, the bacteria differentiate into a new form that can convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia. Bacterial differentiation and nitrogen fixation are dependent on the microaerobic environment and other support factors provided by the plant. In return, the plant receives nitrogen from the bacteria, which allows it to grow in the absence of an external nitrogen source. Here, we review recent discoveries about the mutual recognition process that allows the model rhizobial symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti to invade and differentiate inside its host plant alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and the model host plant barrel medic (Medicago truncatula).},

abstract = {Here we determine the complete genomic sequence of the gram negative, gamma-Proteobacterium Vibrio cholerae El Tor N16961 to be 4,033,460 base pairs (bp). The genome consists of two circular chromosomes of 2,961,146 bp and 1,072,314 bp that together encode 3,885 open reading frames. The vast majority of recognizable genes for essential cell functions (such as DNA replication, transcription, translation and cell-wall biosynthesis) and pathogenicity (for example, toxins, surface antigens and adhesins) are located on the large chromosome. In contrast, the small chromosome contains a larger fraction (59{\%}) of hypothetical genes compared with the large chromosome (42{\%}), and also contains many more genes that appear to have origins other than the gamma-Proteobacteria.

abstract = {Studies had found that bacterial genes are preferentially located on the leading strands. Subsequently, the preferences of essential genes and highly expressed genes were compared by classifying all genes into four groups, which showed that the former has an exclusive influence on orientation. However, only some functional classes of essential genes have this orientation bias. Nevertheless, previous studies only performed comparative analyzes by differentiating the orientation bias extent of two types of genes. Thus, it is unclear whether the influence of essentiality on strand bias works continuously. Herein, we found a significant correlation between essentiality and orientation bias extent in 19 of 21 analyzed bacterial genomes, based on quantitative measurement of gene essentiality (or fitness). The correlation coefficient was much higher than that derived from binary essentiality measures (essential or non-essential). This suggested that genes with relatively lower essentiality, i.e., conditionally essential genes, also have some orientation bias, although it is weaker than that of absolutely essential genes. The results demonstrated the continuous influence of essentiality on orientation bias and provided details on this visible structural feature of bacterial genomes. It also proved that Geptop and IFIM could serve as useful resources of bacterial gene essentiality, particularly for quantitative analysis.},

abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), a major human pathogen, is well known for its adaptation to various host environments. Multiple DNA inversions in the three DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes (hsdS A, hsdS B, and hsdS C) of the colony opacity determinant (cod) locus generate extensive epigenetic and phenotypic diversity. However, it is unclear whether all three hsdS genes are functional and how the inversions mechanistically occur. In this work, our transcriptional analysis revealed active expression of hsdS A but not hsdS B and hsdS C, indicating that hsdS B and hsdS C do not produce functional proteins and instead act as sources for altering the sequence of hsdS A by DNA inversions. Consistent with our previous finding that the hsdS inversions are mediated by three pairs of inverted repeats (IR1, IR2, and IR3), this study showed that the 15-bp IR1 and its upstream sequence are strictly required for the inversion between hsdS A and hsdS B Furthermore, a single tyrosine recombinase PsrA catalyzes the inversions mediated by IR1, IR2, and IR3, based on the dramatic loss of these inversions in the psrA mutant. Surprisingly, PsrA-independent inversions were also detected in the hsdS sequences flanked by the IR2 (298 bp) and IR3 (85 bp) long inverted repeats, which appear to occur spontaneously in the absence of site-specific or RecA-mediated recombination. Because the HsdS subunit is responsible for the sequence specificity of type I restriction modification DNA methyltransferase, these results have revealed that S. pneumoniae varies the methylation patterns of the genome DNA (epigenetic status) by employing multiple mechanisms of DNA inversion in the cod locus.IMPORTANCE Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major pathogen of human infections with the capacity for adaptation to host environments, but the molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain unclear. Previous studies reveal that pneumococcus extends epigenetic and phenotypic diversity by DNA inversions in three methyltransferase hsdS genes of the cod locus. This work revealed that only the hsdS gene that is in the same orientation as hsdM is actively transcribed, but the other two are silent, serving as DNA sources for inversions. While most of the hsdS inversions are catalyzed by PsrA recombinase, the sequences bound by long inverted repeats also undergo inversions via an unknown mechanism. Our results revealed that S. pneumoniae switches the methylation patterns of the genome (epigenetics) by employing multiple mechanisms of DNA inversion.},

abstract = {Background: Population genetic analyses based on genome-wide sequencing data have been carried out for Sinorhizobium medicae and S. meliloti, two closely related bacterial species forming nitrogen-fixing symbioses with plants of the genus Medicago. However, genome coverage was low or the isolates had a broad geographic distribution, making it difficult to interpret the estimated diversity and to unravel the early events underlying population genetic variations and ecological differentiation. Results: Here, to gain insight into the early genome level variation and diversification within S. meliloti populations, we first used Illumina paired-end reads technology to sequence a new clone of S. meliloti strain GR4, a highly competitive strain for alfalfa nodulation. The Illumina data and the GR4 genome sequence previously obtained with 454 technology were used to generate a high-quality reference genome sequence. We then used Illumina technology to sequence the genomes of 13 S. meliloti isolates representative of the genomic variation within the GR4-type population, obtained from a single field site with a high degree of coverage. The genome sequences obtained were analyzed to determine nucleotide diversity, divergence times, polymorphism and genomic variation. Similar low levels of nucleotide diversity were observed for the chromosome, pSymB and pSymA replicons. The isolates displayed other types of variation, such as indels, recombination events, genomic island excision and the transposition of mobile elements. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the GR4-type population has experienced a process of demographic expansion and behaves as a stable genotypic cluster of genome-wide similarity, with most of the genome following a clonal pattern of evolution. Although some of genetic variation detected within the GR4-type population is probably due to genetic drift, others might be important in diversification and environmental adaptation.},

A highly ordered chromosome structure, established while DNA replication and partitioning are in progress, is maintained and propagated during growth. Duplication of the chromosome and partitioning of the newly generated daughter strands are interwoven processes driven by the dynamic interplay between the synthesis, segregation and condensation of DNA. These events are intimately coupled with the bacterial cell cycle and exhibit a previously unanticipated complexity reminiscent of eukaryotic systems.},

abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer is now recognized as an important mechanism of evolution. Several methods to detect horizontally transferred genes have been suggested. These methods are based on either nucleotide composition or the failure to find a similar gene in closely related species. Genes that evolve vertically between closely related species can be divided into those that retain homologous chromosomal positions (positional orthologs) and those that do not. By comparing open reading frames in the Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi genomes, we identified 2,728 positional orthologs since these species split 100 MYA. A group of 1,144 novel E. coli genes were unusually diverged from their S. typhi counterparts. These novel genes included those that had been horizontally transferred into E. coli, as well as members of gene pairs that had been rearranged or deleted. Positional orthologs were used to investigate compositional methods of identifying horizontally transferred genes. A large number of E. coli genes with normal nucleotide composition have no apparent ortholog in S. typhi, and many genes of atypical composition do, in fact, have positional orthologs. A phylogenetic approach was employed to confirm selected examples of horizontal transmission among the novel groups of genes. Our analysis of 80 E. coli genes determined that a number of genes previously classified as horizontally transferred based on base composition and codon bias were native, and genes previously classified as native appeared to be horizontally transferred. Hence, atypical nucleotide composition alone is not a reliable indicator of horizontal transmission.},

The isotopic labeling of the periplasmic beta-1,2-glucans synthesized from glucose labeled at various positions evidenced the involvement of catabolic pathways, namely the pentose-phosphate and Entner-Doudoroff pathways, into the early steps of polysaccharide synthesis. The exopolysaccharides produced at the same time had a labeling pattern similar to that of the beta-glucans, indicating similar early steps for both polysaccharides. The results emphasized a cyclic organization of the carbohydrate metabolism in S. meliloti, in which the carbons of the initial hexose were allowed to re-enter the catabolic pathways many times. The metabolic incidences of such metabolic topology are discussed.},

abstract = {Recent advances in high-throughput cDNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can reveal new genes and splice variants and quantify expression genome-wide in a single assay. The volume and complexity of data from RNA-seq experiments necessitate scalable, fast and mathematically principled analysis software. TopHat and Cufflinks are free, open-source software tools for gene discovery and comprehensive expression analysis of high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Together, they allow biologists to identify new genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well as compare gene and transcript expression under two or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome assembly, lists of differentially expressed and regulated genes and transcripts, and publication-quality visualizations of analysis results. The protocol's execution time depends on the volume of transcriptome sequencing data and available computing resources but takes less than 1 d of computer time for typical experiments and approximately 1 h of hands-on time.},

@article{phylip,
abstract = {Comparative methods analyses have usually assumed that the species phenotypes are the true means for those species. In most analyses, the actual values used are means of samples of modest size. The covariances of contrasts then involve both the covariance of evolutionary changes and a fraction of the within-species phenotypic covariance, the fraction depending on the sample size for that species. Ives et al. have shown how to analyze data in this case when the within-species phenotypic covariances are known. The present model allows them to be unknown and to be estimated from the data. A multivariate normal statistical model is used for multiple characters in samples of finite size from species related by a known phylogeny, under the usual Brownian motion model of change and with equal within-species phenotypic covariances. Contrasts in each character can be obtained both between individuals within a species and between species. Each contrast can be taken for all of the characters. These sets of contrasts, each the same contrast taken for different characters, are independent. The within-set covariances are unequal and depend on the unknown true covariance matrices. An expectation-maximization algorithm is derived for making a reduced maximum likelihood estimate of the covariances of evolutionary change and the within-species phenotypic covariances. It is available in the Contrast program of the PHYLIP package. Computer simulations show that the covariances are biased when the finiteness of sample size is not taken into account and that using the present model corrects the bias. Sampling variation reduces the power of inference of covariation in evolution of different characters. An extension of this method to incorporate estimates of additive genetic covariances from a simple genetic experiment is also discussed.},

RESULTS: The value of NGS read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested.

abstract = {Bacterial genome evolution is characterized by gains, losses, and rearrangements of functional genetic segments. The extent to which large-scale genomic alterations influence genotype-phenotype relationships has not been investigated in a high-throughput manner. In the symbiotic soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, the genome is composed of a chromosome and two large extrachromosomal replicons (pSymA and pSymB, which together constitute 45{\%} of the genome). Massively parallel transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-seq) was employed to evaluate the contributions of chromosomal genes to growth fitness in both the presence and absence of these extrachromosomal replicons. Ten percent of chromosomal genes from diverse functional categories are shown to genetically interact with pSymA and pSymB. These results demonstrate the pervasive robustness provided by the extrachromosomal replicons, which is further supported by constraint-based metabolic modeling. A comprehensive picture of core S. meliloti metabolism was generated through a Tn-seq-guided in silico metabolic network reconstruction, producing a core network encompassing 726 genes. This integrated approach facilitated functional assignments for previously uncharacterized genes, while also revealing that Tn-seq alone missed over a quarter of wild-type metabolism. This work highlights the many functional dependencies and epistatic relationships that may arise between bacterial replicons and across a genome, while also demonstrating how Tn-seq and metabolic modeling can be used together to yield insights not obtainable by either method alone.},

We have confirmed this protein-protein interaction in vitro. We show further that replication termination involves protein-protein interaction between Tus and DnaB at a critical region of Tus protein, called the L1 loop. Several mutations located in the L1 loop region not only reduced the protein-protein interaction but also eliminated or reduced the ability of the mutant forms of Tus to arrest DnaB at a Ter site. At least one mutation, E49K, significantly reduced Tus-DnaB interaction and almost completely eliminated the contrahelicase activity of Tus protein in vitro without significantly reducing the affinity of the mutant form of Tus for Ter DNA, in comparison with the wild-type protein. The results, considered along with the crystal structure of Tus-Ter complex, not only elucidate further the mechanism of helicase arrest but also explain the molecular basis of polarity of replication fork arrest at Ter sites.},

abstract = {The genomes of three Pyrococcus species, P.abyssi, P.furiosus and P.horikoshii, were compared at the DNA level, taking advantage of our identification of their replication origins. Three types of rearrangements have been identified: (i) inversion and translation across the replication axis (origin/terminus), (ii) inversion and translocation restricted to a replichore (the half chromosome divided by the replication axis) and (iii) apparent mobility of long clusters of repeated sequences. Rearrangements restricted within a replichore were more common between P.furiosus and the two other Pyrococcus species than between P.horikoshii and P.abyssi. A strong correlation was found between 23 homologous insertion sequence elements, present only in P.furiosus, and recombined segment boundaries, suggesting that transposition events have been a major cause of genomic disruption in this species. Moreover, gene orientation bias was much more disrupted than strand composition biases in fragments that switched their orientation within a replichore upon recombination. This allowed us to conclude that one reversion and one translation occurred in P.abyssi after its divergence from P.horikoshii, and that a smaller segment has specifically recombined in P.furiosus. Whereas a majority of genes are transcribed in the same direction as DNA replication in P.horikoshii and P.abyssi, the colinearity of transcription and replication is only maintained for highly transcribed genes in P.furiosus. We discuss the implications of genomic rearrangements on gene orientation and composition biases, and their consequences on sequence evolution.},

@article{Cast:00,
abstract = {The use of some multiple-sequence alignments in phylogenetic analysis, particularly those that are not very well conserved, requires the elimination of poorly aligned positions and divergent regions, since they may not be homologous or may have been saturated by multiple substitutions. A computerized method that eliminates such positions and at the same time tries to minimize the loss of informative sites is presented here. The method is based on the selection of blocks of positions that fulfill a simple set of requirements with respect to the number of contiguous conserved positions, lack of gaps, and high conservation of flanking positions, making the final alignment more suitable for phylogenetic analysis. To illustrate the efficiency of this method, alignments of 10 mitochondrial proteins from several completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes belonging to diverse eukaryotes were used as examples. The percentages of removed positions were higher in the most divergent alignments. After removing divergent segments, the amino acid composition of the different sequences was more uniform, and pairwise distances became much smaller. Phylogenetic trees show that topologies can be different after removing conserved blocks, particularly when there are several poorly resolved nodes. Strong support was found for the grouping of animals and fungi but not for the position of more basal eukaryotes. The use of a computerized method such as the one presented here reduces to a certain extent the necessity of manually editing multiple alignments, makes the automation of phylogenetic analysis of large data sets feasible, and facilitates the reproduction of the final alignment by other researchers.},

A number of different factors appear to cooperate in condensing DNA into a highly dynamic assembly of supercoiled loops. Despite this variability in the lower levels of chromatin structure, the global arrangement of chromosomal DNA within the cell is surprisingly conserved, with loci being arrayed along the cellular long axis in line with their order on the genomic map. This conserved pattern is propagated during the course of DNA segregation. First, after entry into S-phase, the newly synthesized origin regions are segregated in an active and directed process, involving the bacterial actin homolog MreB. Subsequent DNA segments then follow by different mechanisms. They are separated immediately after release from the replisome and move rapidly to their conserved positions in the incipient daughter cell compartments. Partitioning of the bacterial chromosome thus takes place while DNA replication is in progress.},

However, as more microbial genome sequencing projects are completed, it is becoming clear that multipartite genomes comprised of more than one chromosome are not unusual among prokaryotes. Chromosomes are distinguished from plasmids by the presence of essential genes as well as characteristic cell cycle-linked replication kinetics; unlike plasmids, chromosomes initiate replication once per cell cycle. The existence of multipartite prokaryotic genomes raises several questions regarding how multiple chromosomes are replicated and segregated during the cell cycle. These divided genomes also introduce questions regarding chromosome evolution and genome stability. In this review, we discuss these and other issues, with particular emphasis on the cholera pathogen Vibrio cholerae.},

Four other analyses appropriate to this task are G+C genome variation (the standard method); genomic signature divergences (dinucleotide bias); extremes of codon bias; and anomalies of amino acid usage. For example, the cagA domain of Helicobacter pylori is highly deviant in its genome signature and codon bias from the rest of the genome. Using these methods we can detect two potential PAIs in the Neisseria meningitidis genome, which contain hemagglutinin and/or hemolysin-related genes. Additionally, G+C variation and genome signature differences of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome indicate two pA gene clusters.},

abstract = {Many bacterial species, such as the alphaproteobacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, are characterized by open pangenomes and contain multipartite genomes consisting of a chromosome and other large-sized replicons, such as chromids, megaplasmids, and plasmids. The evolutionary forces in both functional and structural aspects that shape the pangenome of species with multipartite genomes are still poorly understood. Therefore, we sequenced the genomes of 10 new S. meliloti strains, analyzed with four publicly available additional genomic sequences. Results indicated that the three main replicons present in these strains (a chromosome, a chromid, and a megaplasmid) partly show replicon-specific behaviors related to strain differentiation. In particular, the pSymB chromid was shown to be a hot spot for positively selected genes, and, unexpectedly, genes resident in the pSymB chromid were also found to be more widespread in distant taxa than those located in the other replicons. Moreover, through the exploitation of a DNA proximity network, a series of conserved "DNA backbones" were found to shape the evolution of the genome structure, with the rest of the genome experiencing rearrangements. The presented data allow depicting a scenario where the pSymB chromid has a distinctive role in intraspecies differentiation and in evolution through positive selection, whereas the pSymA megaplasmid mostly contributes to structural fluidity and to the emergence of new functions, indicating a specific evolutionary role for each replicon in the pangenome evolution.},

There are a number of techniques to represent and organize data gleaned from these cohorts, many using ideas implicitly or explicitly borrowed from graph-based models.

chromosome segregation in bacteria and eukaryotes share similarities, although
bacteria segregate DNA as it replicates and lack a eukaryote-like mitotic
apparatus for segregating chromosomes. This may be because the distances that
newly replicated bacterial chromosomes move apart before cell division are small

abstract = {The method of Hidden Markov Models is used to allow for unequal and unknown
evolutionary rates at different sites in molecular sequences. Rates of evolution
at different sites are assumed to be drawn from a set of possible rates, with a
finite number of possibilities. The overall likelihood of phylogeny is calculated
as a sum of terms, each term being the probability of the data given a particular
assignment of rates to sites, times the prior probability of that particular
combination of rates. The probabilities of different rate combinations are
specified by a stationary Markov chain that assigns rate categories to sites.
While there will be a very large number of possible ways of assigning rates to
sites, a simple recursive algorithm allows the contributions to the likelihood
from all possible combinations of rates to be summed, in a time proportional to
the number of different rates at a single site. Thus with three rates, the effort
involved is no greater than three times that for a single rate. This "Hidden
Markov Model" method allows for rates to differ between sites and for
correlations between the rates of neighboring sites. By summing over all
possibilities it does not require us to know the rates at individual sites.
However, it does not allow for correlation of rates at nonadjacent sites, nor
does it allow for a continuous distribution of rates over sites. It is shown how
to use the Newton-Raphson method to estimate branch lengths of a phylogeny and to
infer from a phylogeny what assignment of rates to sites has the largest
posterior probability. An example is given using beta-hemoglobin DNA sequences in
eight mammal species; the regions of high and low evolutionary rates are inferred
and also the average length of patches of similar rates.},

abstract = {In Escherichia coli, chromosome replication is initiated from oriC by the DnaA initiator protein associated with ATP. Three non-coding regions contribute to the activity of DnaA. The datA locus is instrumental in conversion of DnaA(ATP) to DnaA(ADP) (datA dependent DnaA(ATP) hydrolysis) whereas DnaA rejuvenation sequences 1 and 2 (DARS1 and DARS2) reactivate DnaA(ADP) to DnaA(ATP). The structural organization of oriC, datA, DARS1, and DARS2 were found conserved among 59 fully sequenced E. coli genomes, with differences primarily in the non-functional spacer regions between key protein binding sites. The relative distances from oriC to datA, DARS1, and DARS2, respectively, was also conserved despite of large variations in genome size, suggesting that the gene dosage of either region is important for bacterial growth. Yet all three regions could be deleted alone or in combination without loss of viability. Competition experiments during balanced growth in rich medium and during mouse colonization indicated roles of datA, DARS1, and DARS2 for bacterial fitness although the relative contribution of each region differed between growth conditions. We suggest that this fitness advantage has contributed to conservation of both sequence and chromosomal location for datA, DARS1, and DARS2.},

abstract = {DNA (class 2) transposons are mobile genetic elements which move within their
'host' genome through excising and re-inserting elsewhere. Although the rice
genome contains tens of thousands of such elements, their actual role in
evolution is still unclear. Analysing over 650 transposon polymorphisms in the
rice species Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima, we find that DNA repair following
transposon excisions is associated with an increased number of mutations in the
sequences neighbouring the transposon. Indeed, the 3,000 bp flanking the excised
transposons can contain over 10 times more mutations than the genome-wide
average. Since DNA transposons preferably insert near genes, this is correlated
with increases in mutation rates in coding sequences and regulatory regions. Most
importantly, we find this phenomenon also in maize, wheat and barley. Thus, these
findings suggest that DNA transposon activity is a major evolutionary force in
grasses which provide the basis of most food consumed by humankind.},

abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) play an important role in the responsive capacity of their hosts in the face of environmental challenges. The variety of mechanisms by which TEs influence the capacity of adaptation of the host is as large as the variety of TEs and host genomes. For example, TEs might directly affect the function of individual genes, provide a mechanism for rapidly acquiring new genetic material and disseminate regulatory elements that can lead to the creation of stress-inducible regulatory networks. In this review, we summarize recent examples that are part of an increasing body of evidence suggesting a significant role of TEs in the host response to an ever-changing environment, both in prokaryote and in eukaryote organisms. We argue that in the near future, the increasing availability of genome sequences and the development of new tools to discover and analyse TE insertions will further show the relevant role of TEs in environmental adaptation.},

abstract = {Insertion sequences (ISs), arguably the smallest and most numerous autonomous transposable elements (TEs), are important players in shaping their host genomes. This review focuses on prokaryotic ISs. We discuss IS distribution and impact on genome evolution. We also examine their effects on gene expression, especially their role in activating neighbouring genes, a phenomenon of particular importance in the recent upsurge of bacterial antibiotic resistance. We explain how ISs are identified and classified into families by a combination of characteristics including their transposases (Tpases), their overall genetic organisation and the accessory genes which some ISs carry. We then describe the organisation of autonomous and nonautonomous IS-related elements. This is used to illustrate the growing recognition that the boundaries between different types of mobile element are becoming increasingly difficult to define as more are being identified. We review the known Tpase types, their different catalytic activities used in cleaving and rejoining DNA strands during transposition, their organisation into functional domains and the role of this in regulation. Finally, we consider examples of prokaryotic IS domestication. In a more speculative section, we discuss the necessity of constructing more quantitative dynamic models to fully appreciate the continuing impact of TEs on prokaryotic populations.},

abstract = {Streptomyces chromosomes are linear DNA molecules and yet their genetic maps based on linkage analysis are circular. The only other known examples of this phenomenon are in the bacteriophages T2 and T4, the linear genomic sequences of which are circularly permuted and terminally redundant, and in which replication intermediates include long concatemers. These structural and functional features are not found in Streptomyces. Instead, the circularity of Streptomyces genetic maps appears to be caused by a completely different mechanism postulated by Stahl {\&} Steinberg (1964, Genetics 50, 531-538)--a strong bias toward even numbers of crossovers during recombination creates misleading genetic linkages between markers on the opposite arms of the chromosome. This was demonstrated by physical inspection of the telomeres in recombinant chromosomes after interspecies conjugation promoted by a linear or circular plasmid. The preference for even numbers of crossovers is probably demanded by the merozygosity of the recombining chromosomes, and by the association between the telomeres mediated by interactions of covalently bound terminal proteins.},
