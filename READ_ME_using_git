# This document will give you info about how to use git on the command
# line!
#
# NOTE: at any point if you are prompted to "Enter passphrase for key"
# just type empty. No letter will appear on the screen but the machine
# will know you are typing something!

###############################
# UPDATE YOUR LOCAL REPOSITORY
###############################
# ALWAYS DO THIS BEFORE YOU START ANYTHING!
# First thing you do when you start working is pull! This will make
# sure that you have the most up to date info. So if I made changes,
# you will have them! Type this into the command line:
git pull

###############################
# ADD YOUR CHANGES
###############################
# Every time you make a change, you need to 'add' it so git can keep
# track of the change. Type this into the command line:
git add INSERT_YOUR_FILE_NAME(S)_HERE

###############################
# COMMENT ON YOUR CHANGES
###############################
# Once you are done making changes, you need to add an informative
# comment about what changes you made. Type this into the command
# line:
git commit
# this will then open a VIM file that will show you what file(s) you
# added and what changes you made. Then you just need to add in your
# comment (if you forget how to edit things in VIM ask me or do a
# quick bit of googling!). For example you can type "I added a new R
# code that reads in my files". Make it short but informative so we
# can find it later on if we need to! This also makes it super easy
# and great when you need to go back and edit code (which I do all the
# time)
# Then you save and exit your VIM file and it should also save the
# commit!

###############################
# PUSH TO ONLINE REPOSITORY
###############################
# DO THIS BEFORE YOU SIGN OFF OF THE MACHINES OR STOP WORKING!
# Once you are done making all your changes you need up update them on
# the online repository. This way everyone has access to the most
# updated files! Type this into the command line:
git push
