# redundant proteomes
# K12 MG1655 = BW25113
# K12 DH10B = K12 W3110
# ATCC = CFT073
#
# all blast outputs including ATCC and DH have duplicated RBBH's for
# the gene ecpD. This gene name is associated with two proteins
# (Q8FKL3 and A0A0H2V4S3) but only one is actually in the gbk file
# (Q8FKL3) so this is the RBBH that will be chosen.
